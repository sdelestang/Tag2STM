\title{Tag-Recapture Growth Model with Size Transition Matrices}
\usage{
growmod(pin)
}
\arguments{
\item{pin}{List. Parameter list created by \code{\link{Makepin}}, containing
initial values for all model parameters including growth parameters,
measurement error terms, and random effects.}
}
\value{
Scalar numeric value representing the total negative log-likelihood
(TLL) to be minimized. Lower values indicate better model fit. The function
also populates numerous objects via \code{REPORT()} for post-fit diagnostics
(see Details).
}
\description{
Estimates flexible, data-driven growth patterns from tag-recapture data by
constructing size transition matrices (STMs) that describe how animals grow
from one length bin to another over time. The model accounts for measurement
error at both release and recapture, and can include individual-level variation
in measurement precision. The resulting STMs can be directly incorporated into
length-based stock assessment models.
}
\details{
\strong{Model Overview:}

This function implements a tag-recapture growth model that:
\enumerate{
\item Constructs size transition matrices (STMs) from flexible growth parameters
\item Projects each tagged animal forward through time using appropriate STMs
\item Compares projected size distributions with observed recapture lengths
\item Maximizes a multinomial-like likelihood weighted by release cohort sizes
}

\strong{Required Data (from \code{datain}):}

The function uses \code{getAll(datain, pin)} to load data and parameters, requiring:
\itemize{
\item \code{Rlcl}: Release lengths (carapace length) for each tagged animal
\item \code{Rccl}: Recapture lengths for each tagged animal
\item \code{tsteps}: Time at liberty (number of time steps) for each animal
\item \code{relts}: Release time step for each animal
\item \code{nlob}: Number of lobsters in each release cohort (for weighting)
\item \code{lbin}: Vector of length bin midpoints
\item \code{lbinL}: Lower bounds of length bins
\item \code{lbinU}: Upper bounds of length bins
\item \code{nlbin}: Number of length bins
\item \code{ntsteps}: Total number of time steps (e.g., 12 for monthly)
\item \code{goodts}: Vector of time steps with sufficient data for estimation
\item \code{smoother}: Smoothness penalty weight for growth parameters
}

\strong{Growth Model Structure:}

Growth is modeled using a random walk approach:
\enumerate{
\item Growth parameters (\code{growth_vecpar}) are reshaped into a matrix
with \code{nlbin} columns and \code{ntsteps} rows
\item For each time step in \code{goodts}, parameters are converted to
cumulative growth starting from the largest length bin (minimal growth)
and adding increments for each smaller bin
\item Growth can vary flexibly with both size and season/time
\item A smoothness penalty encourages adjacent length bins to have similar growth
}

\strong{Size Transition Matrix (STM) Construction:}

For each time step in \code{goodts}:
\itemize{
\item For each "from" length bin \code{fm}, animals grow according to
\code{growthmat[timestep, fm]}
\item Growth variability is modeled with constant variance \code{sigGrowsd}
\item Transition probabilities to "to" length bins are calculated using
truncated normal distributions: \code{pnorm(lbinU, mean, sd) - pnorm(lbinL, mean, sd)}
\item This creates an \code{nlbin × nlbin} matrix for each time step
}

\strong{Measurement Error Model:}

The model accounts for two sources of measurement error:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Baseline error} (\code{sigError}): Applied to all measurements,
representing instrument precision and rounding
\item \strong{Individual random effects} (\code{MerrorRel}, \code{MerrorRec}):
Individual-specific deviations at release and recapture, useful for
capturing differences between taggers or measurement conditions
}

At both release and recapture, the observed length is treated as uncertain,
and this uncertainty is propagated through the model by creating probability
distributions across length bins.

\strong{Likelihood Calculation:}

For each tagged animal:
\enumerate{
\item Create release length distribution including measurement error
\item Project forward through time using STMs for each time step at liberty
\item Create recapture length distribution including measurement error
\item Calculate Kullback-Leibler divergence between projected and observed
distributions
\item Weight by \code{nlob} (number of animals in release cohort)
}

The likelihood is:
\deqn{LL_r = \sum_{l} (p_{obs,l} + \epsilon) \times \log\frac{p_{proj,l} + \epsilon}{p_{obs,l} + \epsilon} \times n_{lob,r}}
where \code{epsilon = 1e-8} prevents numerical issues.

\strong{Time Step Cycling:}

The model handles cyclical time steps (e.g., annual cycles):
\itemize{
\item If an animal is at liberty longer than \code{ntsteps}, time steps
cycle back to 1
\item This allows modeling seasonal growth patterns with multi-year recaptures
\item Growth in time steps not in \code{goodts} is held constant (no STM applied)
}

\strong{Penalties and Priors:}

The model includes several penalty terms to regularize parameter estimates:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Measurement error prior}: Normal prior on \code{LsigError}
centered at log(2) with SD = 0.5, providing weak regularization
\item \strong{Random effects}: Normal priors on individual measurement errors
\code{MerrorRel} and \code{MerrorRec} centered at 0 with SDs controlled
by \code{LMerrorRelsigma} and \code{LMerrorRecsigma}
\item \strong{Smoothness penalty}: Penalizes differences between adjacent
growth increments within the first time step, weighted by \code{smoother}.
This prevents unrealistic zigzag growth patterns across length bins.
}

\strong{Reported Objects:}

The following objects are made available via \code{REPORT()} for post-fit
examination using \code{sdreport()}:
\describe{
\item{LL}{Vector of individual log-likelihoods for each tagged animal}
\item{lenout}{Matrix showing growth progression over 30 years starting
from the smallest length bin, useful for visualizing growth trajectories}
\item{EstCapLen}{Matrix of observed recapture length distributions
(including measurement error) for each animal}
\item{EstRecLen}{Matrix of model-projected length distributions for each
animal after growth}
\item{stm}{3D array (\code{nlbin × nlbin × ntsteps}) of size transition
matrices - the primary output for use in stock assessment models}
\item{sigGrowvec}{Vector of growth SDs (for legacy compatibility)}
\item{growthmat}{Matrix of mean growth by length bin and time step}
\item{MerrorRel}{Estimated individual measurement errors at release}
\item{MerrorRec}{Estimated individual measurement errors at recapture}
}
}
\section{Typical Workflow}{

\preformatted{
# 1. Prepare data
datain <- list(
  Rlcl = release_lengths,
  Rccl = recapture_lengths,
  tsteps = time_at_liberty,
  relts = release_timesteps,
  nlob = cohort_sizes,
  lbin = length_bins,
  lbinL = bin_lower_bounds,
  lbinU = bin_upper_bounds,
  nlbin = length(length_bins),
  ntsteps = 12,  # monthly
  goodts = c(1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 12),  # moulting seasons
  smoother = 1.0
)

# 2. Create initial parameters
pin <- Makepin(LsigError = log(2), LsigGrow = log(0.15))

# 3. Create parameter mapping
map <- Makemap(pin, re = FALSE)
map$LsigError <- NULL  # Estimate measurement error

# 4. Build and fit model
obj <- MakeADFun(growmod, pin, map = map)
opt <- nlminb(obj$par, obj$fn, obj$gr)

# 5. Extract results
rep <- obj$report()
stm_array <- rep$stm  # Use in stock assessment
growth_curves <- rep$growthmat
}
}

\section{Model Assumptions}{

\itemize{
\item Growth variability is constant across length bins (not proportional)
\item Measurement error is normally distributed with constant variance
\item Growth is deterministic within a time step (individual variation
captured by STM spread, not stochastic growth)
\item Animals in the same release cohort are exchangeable
\item Time steps represent biologically meaningful periods (e.g., months, seasons)
}
}

\section{Computational Notes}{

\itemize{
\item Uses automatic differentiation via RTMB/TMB for efficient optimization
\item Individual random effects can be integrated out using Laplace approximation
when \code{random = c("MerrorRel", "MerrorRec")} is specified in \code{MakeADFun()}
\item Smoothness penalty improves numerical stability and prevents overfitting
\item The \code{eps = 1e-8} term prevents log(0) in likelihood calculation
}

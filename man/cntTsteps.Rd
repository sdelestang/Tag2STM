\title{Count Time Steps Between Release and Recapture}
\usage{
cntTsteps(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector of length 6 containing release and recapture information:
element 1 = release year, element 2 = recapture year, element 3 = release month,
element 4 = release half-month, element 5 = recapture month, element 6 = recapture half-month}
}
\value{
Numeric value representing total time steps at liberty, rounded to
the nearest integer.
}
\description{
Calculates the total number of time steps at liberty for a tag-recapture
observation, accounting for fractional time step allocations and spanning
multiple years.
}
\details{
This function expects a \code{times} object in the calling environment (created
by \code{Maketimes()}), which maps month/half-month combinations to time steps
with fractional allocations.

The calculation handles three cases:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Same year} (nyrs = 0): Sum fractional time steps from release to recapture
\item \strong{Multi-year}: Sum from release to year-end, plus complete intermediate
years, plus start of final year to recapture
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# After creating times object with Maketimes()
# Calculate time steps for tag released Nov 2020, recaptured Mar 2022
obs <- c(2020, 2022, 11, 0, 3, 1)  # Release Nov (1st half), Recap Mar (2nd half)
tsteps <- cntTsteps(obs)
}

}

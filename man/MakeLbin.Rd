\title{Create Length Bin Structure}
\usage{
MakeLbin(start, stop, gap = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{start}{Numeric, starting length for bins (lower bound of first bin midpoint).}

\item{stop}{Numeric, ending length for bins (upper bound of last bin midpoint).}

\item{gap}{Numeric, width of each length bin. Default is 2 mm.}
}
\value{
A named list with three numeric vectors:
\describe{
\item{lbin}{Length bin midpoints}
\item{lbinL}{Length bin lower bounds (first bin extended by 20 mm)}
\item{lbinU}{Length bin upper bounds (last bin extended by 20 mm)}
}
}
\description{
Generates length bin midpoints, lower bounds, and upper bounds for size
transition matrix construction. Extends the first and last bins to capture
extreme values.
}
\details{
The first bin's lower bound is extended by 20 mm below the calculated value,
and the last bin's upper bound is extended by 20 mm above, to ensure all
observed lengths fall within the bin structure.
}
\examples{
# Create 2mm bins from 20-200mm carapace length
bins <- MakeLbin(start = 20, stop = 200, gap = 2)
head(bins$lbin)  # Midpoints: 19, 21, 23, ...

# Create 5mm bins
bins <- MakeLbin(start = 50, stop = 150, gap = 5)
